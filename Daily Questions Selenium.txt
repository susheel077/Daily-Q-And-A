1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.

	Selenium is an open source tool that automates webbrowsers using a single interface which lets us
	to write our test scripts in different programming languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Perl,
	Python.
	
	Different Selenium components are:
		1.Selenium WebDriver
		2.Selenium IDE
		3.Selenium Grid
		4.Selenium RC
	
	Selenium WebDriver-->	 Selenium WebDriver is a web framework that permits you to execute cross-browser tests.
	This tool is used for automating web-based application testing to verify that it performs expectedly. 

2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
	Selenium communicates browser with the help of browser drivers which Selenium API requests the browser with the 
	help of browser driver to hit the request and displays the response which Selenium follows W3C compliance where
	earlier it was performed by JSON wire protocol.
		
3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
	Different locators available in Selenium are:
		-->id 
		-->name
		-->className
		-->tagName 
		-->linkText 
		-->partalLinkText
		-->CSS
		-->xPath
	
4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
	ID is preferable more than xPath because  By.ID() is the faster technique because at its root, the call goes down to document.
	getElementById(), which is optimized by most browsers. But, finding elements using XPath is better for locating elements having
	complex selectors, and is no doubt the most flexible selection strategy

5.How to select value in dropdown?
	Import the “Select” package.
	Declare the drop-down element as an instance of the Select class.
	Then selecting the value by different methods present inside the select class.
	
6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
	Absolute xPath--> is a xpath written from the root node of a DOM which can change if there is any change in code.
	One drawback with the absolute xpath is that if there is any change in attributes beginning from the root to the element, 
	our absolute xpath will become invalid. 
	
	Relative xPath-->starts by referring to the element that we want to identify and not from the root node.
	A relative xpath starts with the // symbol. It is mainly used for automation since even if an element is
	removed or added in the DOM, the relative xpath is not impacted.
	
7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
	boolean enabled = driver.findElement(By.checkBox locator(" ")).isEnabled();
	System.out.println("The Checkbox is disabled:"+enabled);

8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
	System.setProperty is by setting the path of our web browser driver for selenium to call the browser through the path location.

	Wheras, WebDriverManager is developed by a Spanish professor named Boni Garcia who developed WebDriverManager which this block of code
	helps us to download the browser drivers without installing browser driver for each browser.

9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
	//tagName[@attribute='attribute vale']/parent::tagName of Parent

10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
	String attr=driver.findElement(By.locator()).getAttribute(); //which returns a string value
	//To print the attribute 
	System.out.println("Attribute:"+attr);
